            article2: "Article 2 (Revenue Share - Important)",
            article2Desc: "The Center issues a unique, identifiable 'Referral Link' to the Partner. Performance is recognized only when a user accesses through the link, completes membership registration, and proceeds with a paid subscription. For paid subscriptions meeting these conditions, **20% of the payment amount** is calculated as the Partner's revenue. The final payout amount is after withholding 3.3% business income tax (National + Local Tax) in accordance with Korean Income Tax Law.",

            article3Desc: "Settlement is processed once a month. Revenue confirmed from the 1st to the last day of each month is paid on the 5th of the following month. If the payment date (5th) falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be paid on the nearest following weekday. For smooth settlement, Partners must provide their own bank account information and tax reporting information through the secure page (My Page) provided by the Center.",
            article4: "Article 4 (Refunds and Cancellation of Revenue)",
            article4Desc: "Partner revenue is paid only for transactions where the actual payment is maintained. Revenue may be cancelled or deducted in the following cases: [Cancellation within Validity Period] If a user cancels or is approved for a refund within 7 days of payment (or within the service refund policy period), no Partner revenue is generated for that transaction. [Refund of Paid Items] If a refund occurs after settlement has already been paid, the Center may deduct it from the 'payment due next month'. If the settlement amount to be deducted is insufficient, the Partner must return the amount upon the Center's request.",
            article5: "Article 5 (Contract Period and Termination based on Performance)",
            article5Desc: "The partnership contract period is 1 year from the approval date. Unless there is a separate intention to terminate up to 1 month before the contract expiration, the contract is automatically extended for 1 year. [Termination due to Underperformance] However, for the effectiveness of the partnership, if the average monthly performance over the past year is less than 3 cases, the Center may refuse to renew the contract or adjust the Partner grade at the time of contract expiration.",
            article6: "Article 6 (Prohibition of Fraudulent Activities)",
            article6Desc: "If it is confirmed that activities were conducted through unfair methods such as repeated payments/cancellations using one's own account (abusing), spreading false information, or infringing on the rights of others, the Center will immediately revoke the Partner qualification and will not pay any generated revenue."
